# Scalar

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/mseng/Scalar/_apis/build/status/microsoft.scalar?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/mseng/Scalar/_build/latest?definitionId=9297&branchName=main)

## What is Scalar?

Scalar is a C# application that manages large Git repositories.

Run `scalar register` in an existing Git repo to enable recommended config
settings and start background maintenance.

If your repo is hosted on a service that supports the
[GVFS Protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/VFSForGit/blob/HEAD/Protocol.md),
such as Azure Repos, then `scalar clone <url>` will create a local enlistment with
abilities like on-demand object retrieval, background maintenance tasks, and
automatically sets Git config values and hooks that enable performance enhancements.
Scalar also assists in setting up sparse enlistments.

See [the documentation](docs/index.md) for more details.

Installing on macOS
------------------

To install Scalar on macOS,
[download the `Installers_macOS_Release.zip` from the releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/scalar/releases).
Extract the `Installers_macOS_Release` folder, `cd` into it, and run `./InstallScalar.sh` in a Terminal window.
The script may prompt for your password as it installs the following components:

* [Git](https://github.com/microsoft/git) (with custom patches)
* [Git Credential Manager Core](https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core)
* Scalar
* [Watchman](https://github.com/facebook/watchman), unless you use the `--no-watchman` argument.

Alternatively, install with Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap microsoft/git
brew cask install scalar
```

Installing on Windows
--------------------

To install Scalar on Windows,
[download the `Installers_Windows_Release.zip` from the releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/scalar/releases).
Extract the `Installers_Windows_Release` folder, open it in a command prompt, and
run `InstallScalar.bat`. This will install the following components:

* [Git for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/git) (with custom patches)
* Scalar
* [Watchman](https://github.com/facebook/watchman), if you use the `--watchman` argument.
