Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Using Scalar
------------

### I don't want a sparse clone, I want every file after I clone!

Run `scalar clone --full-clone <url>` to initialize your repo to include
every file. You can switch to a sparse-checkout later by running
`git sparse-checkout init --cone`.

### I already cloned without `--full-clone`. How do I get everything?

Run `git sparse-checkout disable`.

Scalar Design Decisions
-----------------------

There may be many design decisions within Scalar that are confusing at first
glance. Some of them may cause friction when you use Scalar with your existing
repos and existing habits.

> Scalar has the most benefit when users design repositories
> with efficient patterns.

For example: Scalar uses the sparse-checkout feature to limit the size of the
working directory within a large monorepo. It is designed to work efficiently
with monorepos that are highly componetized, allowing most developers to
need many fewer files in their daily work.

### Why does `scalar clone` create a `<repo>/src` folder?

Scalar uses a file system watcher to keep track of changes under this `src` folder.
Any activity in this folder is assumed to be important to Git operations. By
creating the `src` folder, we are making it easy for your build system to
create output folders outside the `src` directory. We commonly see systems
create folders for build outputs and package downloads. Scalar itself creates
these folders during its builds.

Your build system may create build artifacts such as `.obj` or `.lib` files
next to your source code. These are commonly "hidden" from Git using
`.gitignore` files. Having such artifacts into your source tree creates
additional work for Git because it needs to look at these files and match them
against the `.gitignore` patterns.

By following the pattern Scalar tries to establish and placing your build
intermediates and outputs parallel with the `src` folder and not inside it,
you can help optimize Git command performance for developers in the repository
by limiting the number of files Git needs to consider for many common
operations.
