Getting Started
===============

Registering existing Git repos
------------------------------

To add a repository to the list of registered repos, run `scalar register [<path>]`.
If `<path>` is not provided, then the "current repository" is discovered from
the working directory by scanning the parent paths for a path containing a `.git`
folder, possibly inside a `src` folder.

To see which repositories are currently registered with Scalar, run
`scalar list`.

Run `scalar unregister [<path>]` to remove the repo from this list.

Creating a new Scalar clone using the GVFS Protocol
---------------------------------------------------

The `clone` verb creates a local enlistment of a remote repository using the
[GVFS protocol](https://github.com/microsoft/VFSForGit/blob/HEAD/Protocol.md).

```
scalar clone [options] <url> [<dir>]
```

Create a local copy of the repository at `<url>`. If specified, create the `<dir>`
directory and place the repository there. Otherwise, the last section of the `<url>`
will be used for `<dir>`.

At the end, the repo is located at `<dir>/src`. By default, the sparse-checkout
feature is enabled and the only files present are those in the root of your
Git repository. Use `git sparse-checkout set` to expand the set of directories
you want to see, or `git sparse-checkout disable` to expand to all files. You
can explore the subdirectories outside your sparse-checkout specification using
`git ls-tree HEAD`.

### Sparse Repo Mode

By default, Scalar reduces your working directory to the only the files at the
root of the repository. You need to add the folders you care about to build up
to your working set.

* `scalar clone <url>`
  * Please choose the **Clone with HTTPS** option in the `Clone Repository` dialog in Azure Repos, not **Clone with SSH**.
* `cd <root>\src`
* At this point, your `src` directory only contains files that appear in your root
  tree. No folders are populated.
* Set the directory list for your sparse-checkout using:
	1. `git sparse-checkout set <dir1> <dir2> ...`
	2. `git sparse-checkout set --stdin <dir-list.txt`
* Run git commands as you normally would.
* To fully populate your working directory, run `git sparse-checkout disable`.

If instead you want to start with all files on-disk, you can clone with the
`--full-clone` option. To enable sparse-checkout after the fact, run
`git sparse-checkout init --cone`. This will initialize your sparse-checkout
patterns to only match the files at root.

If you are unfamiliar with what directories are available in the repository,
then you can run `git ls-tree -d --name-only HEAD` to discover the directories
at root, or `git ls-tree -d --name-only HEAD <path>` to discover the directories
in `<path>`.

### Options

These options allow a user to customize their initial enlistment.

* `--full-clone`: If specified, do not initialize the sparse-checkout feature.
  All files will be present in your `src` directory. This behaves very similar
  to a Git partial clone in that blobs are downloaded on demand. However, it
  will use the GVFS protocol to download all Git objects.

* `--cache-server-url=<url>`: If specified, set the intended cache server to
  the specified `<url>`. All object queries will use the GVFS protocol to this
  `<url>` instead of the origin remote. If the remote supplies a list of
  cache servers via the `<url>/gvfs/config` endpoint, then the `clone` command
  will select a nearby cache server from that list.

* `--branch=<ref>`: Specify the branch to checkout after clone.

* `--local-cache-path=<path>`: Use this option to override the path for the
  local Scalar cache. If not specified, then Scalar will select a default
  path to share objects with your other enlistments. On Windows, this path
  is a subdirectory of `<Volume>:\.scalarCache\`. On Mac, this path is a
  subdirectory of `~/.scalarCache/`. The default cache path is recommended so
  multiple enlistments of the same remote repository share objects on the
  same device.

### Advanced Options

The options below are not intended for use by a typical user. These are
usually used by build machines to create a temporary enlistment that
operates on a single commit.

* `--single-branch`: Use this option to only download metadata for the branch
  that will be checked out. This is helpful for build machines that target
  a remote with many branches. Any `git fetch` commands after the clone will
  still ask for all branches.

* `--no-prefetch`: Use this option to not prefetch commits after clone. This
  is not recommended for anyone planning to use their clone for history
  traversal. Use of this option will make commands like `git log` or
  `git pull` extremely slow and is therefore not recommended.

Removing a Scalar Clone
-----------------------

Since the `scalar clone` command sets up a file-system watcher (when available),
that watcher could prevent deleting the enlistment. Run `scalar delete <path>`
from outside of your enlistment to unregister the enlistment from the filesystem
watcher and delete the enlistment at `<path>`.
