The Philosophy of Scalar
========================

> **Note: Scalar has moved!** It is now part of [the `microsoft/git` fork][microsoft-git]
> and thus this document has [a new version in that repository][git-philosophy].

The team building Scalar has **opinions** about Git performance. Scalar
takes out the guesswork by automatically configuring your Git repositories
to take advantage of the latest and greatest features. It is difficult to
say that these are the absolute best settings for every repository, but
these settings do work for some of the largest repositories in the world.

Scalar intends to do very little more than the standard Git client. We
actively implement new features into Git instead of Scalar, then update
Scalar only to configure those new settings. In particular, we are porting
features like background maintenance to Git to make Scalar simpler and
make Git more powerful.

Scalar ships with [a custom version of Git][microsoft-git],
but performs most of its benefits without that version. The only feature
that is not intended to ever reach the standard Git client is Scalar's use
of [the GVFS Protocol][gvfs-protocol].
The GVFS Protocol is a way to reduce object transfer between client and
server, named for its use in [VFS for Git](https://github.com/microsoft/vfsforgit).

If you don't use the GVFS Protocol, then most of the value of Scalar can
be found in the core Git client. However, most of the advanced features
that really optimize Git's performance are off by default for compatibility
reasons. To really take advantage of Git's latest and greatest features,
you either need to study the [`git config` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
and regularly read [the Git release notes](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation/RelNotes).
Even if you do all that work and customize your Git settings on your machines,
you likely will want to share those settings with other team members.
Or, you can just use Scalar!

Using `scalar register` on an existing Git repository will give you these
benefits:

* Additional compression of your `.git/index` file.
* Hourly background `git fetch` operations, keeping you in-sync with your
  remotes.
* Advanced data structures, such as the `commit-graph` and `multi-pack-index`
  are updated automatically in the background.
* If Watchman is installed, then the FileSystem Monitor hook is configured
  to use Watchman's change-tracking, providing faster commands such as
  `git status` or `git add`.

Additionally, if you use `scalar clone` to create a new repository, then
you will automatically get these benefits:

* Use Git's partial clone feature to only download the files you need for
  your current checkout.
* Use Git's [sparse-checkout feature][sparse-checkout] to minimize the
  number of files required in your working directory.
  [Read more about sparse-checkout here.][sparse-checkout-blog] 
* Create the Git repository inside `<repo-name>/src` to make it easy to
  place build artifacts outside of the Git repository, such as in
  `<repo-name>/bin` or `<repo-name>/packages`.

We also admit that these **opinions** can always be improved! If you have
an idea of how to improve our setup, consider [creating an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/scalar/issues/new) or contributing a pull request! Some [existing](https://github.com/microsoft/scalar/issues/382)
[issues](https://github.com/microsoft/scalar/issues/388) have already
improved our configuration settings and roadmap!
